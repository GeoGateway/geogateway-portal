This is the GeoGateway project.  To install, you need to install the NPM package manager, Node.js, Git, and MongoDB. MongoDB's default data directory is /data/db, so either make this directory and give it the correct permissions or else change the data directory.  You may already have Git installed. Just type "git" at the command line to see.

INSTALLATION
Run the following commands at the shell prompt:

* cd $INSTALL_PATH
   - You don't need this environment variable set, but we will use it for clarity.

* git clone https://marpierc_iu@bitbucket.org/marpierc_iu/geogateway.git

* cd $INSTALL_PATH/geogateway

* npm install
   - This will install the packages listed in packages.json.
   - Will need to put npm in your PATH
   - ex: export PATH=~/node-v0.10.36-linux-x64/bin/:$PATH

* cd $INSTALL_PATH/geogateway/html

* bower install  

* mkdir -p $INSTALL_PATH/geogateway/html/userUploads  (make sure this directory exists)

RUNNING THE SERVICE
Run the following commands

* mongod
   - This starts MongoDB and can be run from anywhere.
   - You need mongod in your path
   - ex: export PATH=$HOME/mongodb-linux-x86_64-2.6.7/bin/:$PATH

* cd $INSTALL_PATH/geogateway

* node GeoGatewayServer.js

UPDATING THIRD PARTY DEPENDENCIES
To keep libraries up to date, periodically run the following:
