This is the GeoGateway project.  To install, you need to install the NPM package manager, Node, Git, and MongoDB. MongoDB's default data directory is /data/db, so either make this directory and give it the correct permissions or else change the data directory.

INSTALLATION
Run the following commands:

* cd $INSTALL_PATH
   - You don't need this environment variable set, but we will use it for clarity.

* git clone https://marpierc_iu@bitbucket.org/marpierc_iu/geogateway.git

* cd $INSTALL_PATH/geogateway

* npm install
   - This will install the packages listed in packages.json.
   - Will need to put npm in your PATH
   - ex: export PATH=~/node-v0.10.36-linux-x64/bin/:$PATH

* cd $INSTALL_PATH/geogateway/html

* bower install  

* mkdir $INSTALL_PATH/geogateway/html/userUploads  (make sure this directory exists)

RUNNING THE SERVICE
Run the following commands

* mongod
   - This starts MongoDB and can be run from anywhere.
   - You need mongod in your path
   - ex: export PATH=$HOME/mongodb-linux-x86_64-2.6.7/bin/:$PATH

* cd $INSTALL_PATH/geogateway

* node GeoGatewayServer.js
